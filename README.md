# Games Engine Construction (VIS2068-N)

You are required to design and implement a basic 2D game engine using C++ and the HAPI API. To demonstrate the capabilities of this engine you should create a small game demo.

* There should be a clear separation between the systems of your game (black box systems).
* You should aim to implement a visulation system and a world model.
* Code should be bug free, well commented and maintainable.
* The demo must run initially in a window.
